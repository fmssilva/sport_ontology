Confirm Tests: 
remember i want sparql querries to access only the H2 DB data. sparql queries are NOT to include the ABox values. ABox is only for hermit.  
nevertheless, even if sparq is only to access the H2 DB, it is to perform the full stack query path through the ontop CLI, doing the reasoning procedures and to return the OWA and not the CWA. 


review introduciton and conclusion

falta usar e meter no relatorio as tools pra meter o diagrama


review the pom file to confirm its clean and we don't have there unused or not important commands or dependencies

report: dizer que é tool que facilita tudo: com npm exec:exec@protege_files we get the eveyrhting we need to easy set up of a DB in protege for ontop; and with a npm test we have a test infrastrucure working with sample examples ready to be changed and adapted to a given domain. 

see the project assignment requests. 
and see the deliverables i need to give
and see 
the code we have now implmented
and then confirm what task we have already done and to what level
is it good already for each area and task?
