what are these REA??

Three advanced reasoning test scenarios demonstrate ontology superiority
over traditional SQL approaches. REA-04 (Elite Team complex reasoning test)
showcases automatic class classication where TopTeam entities are inferred
through complex market value criteria, eliminating manual SQL JOIN opera-
tions. REA-05 validates property chain reasoning with transitive league par-
ticipation (playsFor ◦ competesIn → participatesIn), automatically deriving 8
relationships versus explicit SQL traversal. REA-06 conrms inverse property
consistency (hasPlayer ↔ playsFor) ensuring bidirectional data integrity with-
out database triggers

falta usar e meter no relatorio as tools pra meter o diagrama

report: dizer que é tool que facilita tudo: com npm exec:exec@protege_files we get the eveyrhting we need to easy set up of a DB in protege for ontop; and with a npm test we have a test infrastrucure working with sample examples ready to be changed and adapted to a given domain.

Perfect! I found the ontology dropdown menu. It's in the HTML file at lines 129-136. I can see the list of predefined ontologies. Now I need to add our sport ontology to this list. Let me copy our JSON file to the deploy/data folder and then add the entry to the HTML.
